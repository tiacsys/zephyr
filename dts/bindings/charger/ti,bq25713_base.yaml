  Common properties for the BQ25710 and BQ25713 battery charge controller IC.

include: battery.yaml

properties:
  constant-charge-current-max-microamp:
    required: true
    description: |
      The charge current target for the constant current phase of the charge profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 0 mA to 8.128 A.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt:
    required: true
    description: |
      The voltage regulation target for the constant voltage phase of the battery charging profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 4.2 V 1S to 16.8 V 4S.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  system-voltage-min-threshold-microvolt:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Minimum system voltage.
      Voltage that will be set above when the system voltage drops this level.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 1.024 V to 16.128 V.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.
