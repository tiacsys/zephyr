description: ILI9XXX display controllers common properties.

include: [mipi-dbi-spi-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
  spi2mcu-shift:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0
      - 16
    description:
      In rare types of displays, discrete shift registers can be found
      whose task is to convert the serial SPI bit stream to the parallel
      MCU interface with clock and bit accuracy. Typically, these are
      16 bits wide. However, wider expansion stages are also conceivable.

  pixel-format:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0 # RGB565
      - 1 # RGB888
    description:
      Display pixel format. Note that when RGB888 pixel format is selected
      only 6 color bits are actually used being in practice equivalent to
      RGB666.

  rotation:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0
      - 90
      - 180
      - 270
    description:
      Display rotation (CW) in degrees.

  display-inversion:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Display inversion mode. Every bit is inverted from the frame memory to
      the display.
