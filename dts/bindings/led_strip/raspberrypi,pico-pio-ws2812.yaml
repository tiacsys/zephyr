  The pio node configured for ws2812.

compatible: "raspberrypi,pico-pio-ws2812"

include: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  bit-waveform:
    type: array
    description: |
      This property defines the waveform for sending 1-bit data.
      The program uses the first three elements of the array.
      Where, let these value be T0, T1, and T2.
      The T0 is equal to T0H in the datasheet.
      The T2 is equal to T1L in the datasheet.
      The T1 is equal to (T1H-T0H) or (T0L-T1L) in the datasheet.

      The frequency determines the wave period.
      The T0ï½žT2 means ratio in one period.

      For example, T0=3, T1=3, T2=4 and the frequency is 800kHz case,
      T0H is
        (1 / 800kHz) * (3/10) = 375ns
      T0L is
        (1 / 800kHz) * ((4+3)/10) = 875ns
