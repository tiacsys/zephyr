# This increases the ESP UART FIFO so that the maximum required Modbus RTU
# frame size of 256 bytes can fit in it. The uC/Modbus subsystem in Zephyr
# doesn't support fragmentation or defragmentation of singel Modbus RTU
# messages, thus the UART must guarantee that Modbus RTU messages can be
# sent and received at once and in their entirety.
