config STEPPER_TEST_TIMING_TIMEOUT_TOLERANCE_PCT
	int "Stepper timing tolerance percentage"
	default 20
	help
	  Additional margin (%) added to step timing during test timeouts.
	  Accounts for execution and scheduling jitter.

config STEPPER_TEST_MICROSTEP_RESOLUTION
	int "Test microstep resolution"
	default 4
	help
	  Microstep resolution used to test setting the microstep resolution.
	  As not all drivers support all microstep resolutions, so this needs to be adjusted
	  on a per drvier basis.

config STEPPER_TEST_ACCELERATION
	bool "Disables some tests when acceleration is used"
	default n
	help
	  This flag disables several tests cases that can not run correctly if the stepper uses
	  an acceleration curve.
